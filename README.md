# Neural-Network

Simple neural network designed to read handwritten numbers (0-9) from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ and decide on what number they are most likely to represent.

## Development Status

This system is currently in early development, and thus doesn't function as a proper neural network just yet.

## Aims

I aim to create a teaching tool that allows for students to tinker and interact with neural networks. They will be able to design their own networks, and manipulate them as they wish. All this will be available via. a GUI.

## System Structure

### Input data

The input data must either be in either idx3 or png format.

### Output data

The output data can be extracted to a csv, or viewed via the GUI.

### User interface

The GUI provide the tools to adjust the architecture of the network (eg. number of neurons in each layer, how many layers there are in the hidden layer).
